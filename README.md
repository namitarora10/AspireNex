# Internship Assignments 

This repository contains two assignments for the internship round:

1. SMS Spam Detection
2. Customer Churn Prediction

## Assignment 1: SMS Spam Detection

### Overview

This project aims to classify SMS messages as spam or not spam using a Naive Bayes classifier.

### Files

- `spam_sms_detection.ipynb`: Code for training the SMS spam detection model.
- `app.py`: Flask web application for the SMS spam detection model.

### How to Run

1. Ensure you have the `spam.csv` dataset in the repository.
2. Run the Flask web application:
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```
3. Access the application at `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.
4. app.py is included in the code of `spam_sms_detection.ipynb`

### Usage

1. Enter the SMS message in the text box provided.
2. Submit the form to get the prediction (Spam or Not Spam).

### Note

I have created the web app for the SMS Spam Detection project to demonstrate my knowledge of deploying machine learning models using Flask.


### Screenshots

Here are some screenshots of the SMS Spam Detection web app:


## Assignment 2: Customer Churn Prediction

### Overview

This project aims to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service using historical customer data.

### Files

- `customer_churn.ipynb`: Code for data preprocessing and training the customer churn prediction model.
